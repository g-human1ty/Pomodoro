## The Pomodoro Technique

The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. It uses a timer to break work into focused 25-minute intervals separated by short breaks.

**Basic Steps:**
1. Decide on the task to be done
2. Set the pomodoro timer (traditionally to 25 minutes)
3. Work on the task until the timer rings
4. Take a short break (5 minutes)
5. After four pomodoros, take a longer break (15-30 minutes)

This timer helps you implement this technique effectively!
